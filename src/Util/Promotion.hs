-- NOTE: This establishes a link between a /type/ @a ::Type@ and a corresponding
-- kind. Specifically, this can /not/ (and does not need to) be used for types
-- have already been promoted. For example, consider
--
-- > data T :: Bool -> Type -> Type where
-- >   TA :: a -> T True  a
-- >   TB :: a -> T False a
--
-- The appropriate 'Promoted' instance is
--
-- > type instance Promoted (T b a) = T b (Promoted a)
--
-- The boolean /already/ lives at the type-level and so does not (cannot) be
-- promoted; this would be a kind error:
--
-- type instance Promoted (T b a) = T (Promoted b) (Promoted a) -- Incorrect
--
-- because @b@ does not have kind 'Type'.
